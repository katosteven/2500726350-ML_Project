Regional Electricity Load Prediction Using Hybrid Machine Learning Models Under Limited Data Conditions: A Case Study of Uganda

  This project addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting regional electricity consumption in environments with limited
  historical data. It demonstrates a methodical approach to time-series forecasting using a diverse set of machine learning models.

  Project Highlights

   * Data-Efficient Forecasting: Developed and evaluated models for short-term electricity load prediction using sparse historical
     datasets.
   * Comprehensive Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of various models, including SARIMAX, Linear Regression, Random Forest,
     XGBoost, LSTM, and a hybrid ensemble.
   * Emphasis on Feature Engineering: A core finding is the critical impact of meticulous feature engineering, which enabled a simpler,
     interpretable Linear Regression model to outperform more complex models.
   * Practical Insights: Provides valuable strategies for achieving robust predictive accuracy in data-constrained time-series
     analysis.

  Technologies Used

   * Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
   * XGBoost
   * TensorFlow/Keras
   * Matplotlib, Seaborn
